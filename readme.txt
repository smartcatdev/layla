= How many menu items does Layla support ?

Layla supports an unlimited number of menu items, it has been optimized for top-level menus, sub menus and sub-sub menus.
As a recommendation, try to maintain the number of top menu items under 8 or 9 items, because if you add more,
the menu items will drop to a new line and will not look as good as intended.
